# Solving Wiegleb peg solitaire with Temporal Difference Learning, N-tuple and Java.

Features:
- Board is represented by an unidimensional vetor int[45].
- Board.java contains methods to calculate candidate moves, play and print Board.       
- Using  board symmetries: the  n-tuple [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,12,13,14,22] is rotated and applied to board 90/180/270 degree.
- Reward is given only at the end, when there is no more candidate move, +1 if puzzle is solved, -1  for shorter episodes.
- Using replacing eligibility trace to accelerate convergence. See file tdLearning.java  
- Exploration rate start at 0.1 and decays gaussian.
- The global learning rate decays exponentially from 0.005 to 0.002.
- The Gui application wiegleb.java need  JFreeChart package to show graphics.
- The algorithm always find a solution in less than 10min(Core i5 Cpu) and saves the results in puzzleSolved.log file, and sometimes the algorithm "learns"
the solutions. When this happens the 8.192 weights are saved in weight.dat file.
